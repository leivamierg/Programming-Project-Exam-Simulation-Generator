```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

The documentation will be generated in the `target/site/apidocs` folder.

```

## Project's overall description

- Our project is a test simulation software, thought to be used by the users to prepare themselves for a multiple-choice format exam.
- The main feature of our program consists in generating an exam simulation of a chosen topic, representing a specific university course.
- In the simulation the user has a timer indicating the time left, and a Command Line User Interface to see the current question with its
  answers and select one of the given choices. In addition, the user can move around the questions by skipping some parts of the exam or going back to an already seen question.
  The simulation finishes automatically when the timer expires or when the user inserts a command to terminate the simulation.
- Once the simulation is finished the user sees its results and can decide to do another simulation or not.
- Other features of the project include the visualization of the available topics, past simulations data and stats.
- The program selects the questions to put in the simulation based on how many times an answer was present in previous simulations an if it was answered correctly or not, using a priority system for all the questions available.
- The program also makes sure that once the program is closed it saves the priority of the questions, stats and data, and loads them again whenever the program starts.

## User-guide for our project

The program doesnÂ´t use any command line interface anymore. So to comfortably use our program it is enough to run it and interact with the GUI as with any modern application.
Once the program is started it will ask the user for a username, and once the user presses the Enter button it will see the main menu with the different functionalities of the program, which can be selected
by pressing the corresponding button.

## Implementation of the project

### Overall Structure: Model, Controller and App

If you want also a more in depth explanation of the project you can generate the javadoc by running the following command in the root directory of the project

```bash
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```
The documentation will be generated in the `target/site/apidocs` folder.


#### Interfaces

In this directory we can find every interface of the controller classes, including all the public methods of each class implementing an interface together with a javadoc giving a brief explanation on what the method does, its parameters, return types and possible exceptions. Every interface has the same name as its implementing class + the Int sufix.\
There are no interfaces available for the records and the comparators.

#### Implementations

##### Base structural classes (@leivamierg)

We have only three different classes to keep the different questions organised and separated in different areas: Topic, Subtopic and Question.\
The highest hierarchy class would be Topic, parting from there, each Topic object contains many Subtopic objects, and each Subtopic object contains many Question objects. The lowest class on the hierarchy would be Question, not containing any structural class among its various data members.

###### Topic class

Represents a specific university course, for instance: Linear Algebra or Computer Systems Architecture.\
It contains a Set of subtopic representing the different sections of the course.

###### Subtopic class

Represents a university course Chapter/Lesson, for example: (Linear Algebra) Spectral Analysis, etc.\
It contains a set of questions of the current Subtopic, and it is linked to its appertaining Topic object.

###### Question class

Represents a single possible question in a simulation.
Contains the question statement and the possible answers. It is by far the most complex class of the structural classes as it provides many methods to shuffle the possible answers and assign them randomly a letter from A to D.


##### FileLoading, FileSaving and Serialization
We used Jackson to implement JSON serialization and deserialization
- When the program starts the topics (along with subtopics and questions) are loaded by using the static method loadBank of the FileLoader class
- When the program ends the topics are saved into the JSON files by using the static method saveBank of the FileLoaderClass -> when the user re-start the program the last state of the program is loaded
- The same process is valid for History and Stats, which use the HistoryStatsLoader class to be serialized and deserialized

###### PDFGenerator class

This class is designed to convert a JSON file into a well-formatted PDF document. It is based on the Jackson library for JSON processing and Apache PDFBox for the PDF creation. It creates printable simulations for the different topics. 

##### Stats and history classes (@leivamierg and @sebanardin)

These two classes give a sense of progress to the user saving data of previous simulations, they use serialization and deserialization as well to save and load their content.

###### Stats class

This class is meant to store the stats of every topic, subtopic and the general stats after every simulation.
In addition, it supports JSON serialization/deserialization. Moreover, it provides some methods to compare the stats of a certain topic or subtopic from simulation x to simulation y.
Furthermore, it allows the user also to see the stats of a certain topic/subtopic after x simulation.

###### History class

This class is quite simple, it only contains a list of TestRegister records, created specifically to store the previous simulation data. Other than supporting JSON serialization and deserialization it also has methods to see the full or a part of the history in the command line.\
Some data saved in the history are: number of questions, correct answers, wrong questions, used time / available time, etc.

###### User class

This class represents a user in the application who has a username, who can earn badges, mantain streaks and participate in daily challenges. The role of the class is to keep track of the information regarding a specific user.

###### Badge class

This class represents an individual badge that a user can earn during the daily challenges. It provides the model of a badge which can be earned, and it can be used with the 'User' class to represent the badges earned by the user.

###### Simulation class
Represents a simulation of an exam. It provides several functionalities:
- Select the topic the simulation is about -> all the subtopics of the given topic are part of the simulation (the questions are grouped by subtopic)
- Select only some subtopics of a given topic (not implemented but can be tested by running the tests)
- Answer to a question 
- Change the question (either to the previous/next one or to a specific one)
- Terminate the simulation -> the result (general and for each subtopic) is printed and every parameter needed for the next simulations is updated

#####  Model class

Model is mainly a facade for interacting with simulation. In retrospective we should have designed it as a part of the controller.

##### Timer functionality

The timer functionality was implemented to give a duration to the tests' simulation. Each simulation is set to a duration of 30 minutes and the remaining time is displayed every time the user answers to a question.
This way, the remaining time is continuously updated. When the remaining time reaches zero or the user ends the test through the command 'terminate', both the test and the timer are stopped.

#### Comparators

Despite having its own directory, actually there is only one comparator:

##### QuestionPriorityComparator (@leivamierg)

It is a useful tool to sort a question list based on their "priorityLevel" ordering them from lower priority to higher priority.\
It is used on the Subtopic class, for the "pickQuestions" method.

#### DailyChallenge class
The 'DailyChallenge' class is where the logic for the daily challenge is handled. The daily challenge is based on five random questions about any topic, which are presented only once every day to the logged-in user. The latter must answer correctly to at least three of the five questions to win a badge, moreover, the user can accumulate a streak if he/she does the daily challenge more days in a row. The user's data are then saved after the application is closed in a separate json file with the user's name.

### The Controller

##### Controller class

The 'Controller' class handles the user's input and interacts principally with the 'ModelInt' interface.
It parses the commands and calls the relative methods from the 'ModelInt' interface by using regexes. It also relies on 'HistoryInt' and 'StatsInt' for the advanced version of the program.
In the updated version, further interactions with new classes were implemented ('PDFGenerator', 'DailyChallenge', 'User').
The 'elaborateArgs' method is where the list of arguments from the user is processed.
The overall class works as an intermediate between the user and the program, to delegate tasks to methods by processing commands.

### Tests and Utils (@all)
Each class was tested separately by using JUnit tests.

### The App

##### App class

The 'App' class is the entry point for the program. It manages the program's lifecycle (initialization, GUI launch and other important events, such as, closing the program or retrieving the different .fxml files).

##### The Graphical User Interface
###### The FXML files
Each of the FXML files correspond to a JavaFx scene. Which is a certain snapshot with certain elements shown on the application window. 
Most of the elements of each scene are declared within the FXML file, together with its properties (X and Y coordinate, type of button, etc.)
Nevertheless, it is possible to add elements or change properties of the current scene without modifying the fxml file. 
The different components of a scene appear in the FXML file as nested tags, the appartaining Controller class of the scene is also declared at the tag representing the FXML file itself, the most exterior one.
Also, any component whose data will be retrieved and/or modified by a controller class must have the property fx:id=name property.
##### The Controllers
In order to handle the user interaction with each of the scenes of the application a controller class per each scene (each FXML file) is required. Furthermore, if a component must be added or a property must
be changed, without modifying the fxml file, we would need to add the corresponding methods to the Controller class.
###### initialize()
The initialize() method is the first method called as soon as the corresponding scene is accessed by the user. Here we can write different declarations and/or initializations to any parameter we might need
as soon as the scene is displayed.
It is also particularly useful because it lets us add additional elements to the current scene without changing the fxml file. Any further element addition outside the initialize method wonÂ´t work properly.
###### Modifying certain elements properties
In order to interact with an element of the current scene we must add a field of the class of the element with the same name as its fx:id property and with the @FXML tag on the line inmediately above itself.
From then it would be enough to call the different pre-established methods to modify its properties (i.e. .setText("Hello")).
###### Interaction with the user
In order to detect a certain user action and call a method consequently we have to create a normal public non-static method which recieves an event of the class "ActionEvent".
Then we can define the method's content, and then go to the fxml file and define the event which triggers this method, which is usually a certain action with one of the elements
of the scene, such as clicking a button (in this case we would need to add the #onClick property to that element and make it equal to the name of the event Method we have just created)
###### Communication between Controllers
The handling of data passing from one controller to another was implemented by adding spublic tatic properties to the "recieving" controllers which can be accessed and modified by the
"sender" controllerdirectly or by calling a public method of the recieving class wich does exactly that.
###### Thread handling
The javafx library provide some methods to assure the thread synchronization between native Java thread and javafx threads. In the way I did it, to be sure that a serie of lines of code are executed 
before some other serie of lines of code, you first need to create a new Thread object whose constructor doesn't recieve any parameter but some {} must be added inmediately after the parenthesis. 
Which at the end will call the method .start().
Then within the curly braces we write the run method (public and void) containing the "must go first" lines of code. Then, within the run method, after the first lines of code we call the
Class method Platform.runLater() which receives a Runnable objects. We create such an object directly in the parenthesis and we open some curly braces again. Within those last curly braces we finally add
a second public void run method, in which we will add the "must go second" lines of code.

## BUGS
1. Stats and History saving
   Sometimes, due to bad threading, a method might me called with a null parameter, generating an exception. Whenever that happens the Stats class starts having more simulation than the History class
   To check if that has happened go to the MainMenu and click the displayHistory and DisplayGeneralStats buttons, which will trigger a sysout of the number of simulations of the history and in the stats.
   This number shoud be the same in both displays.
   If this happens the saved data is corrupted and it is necessary to go back when both classes had the same number of simulation. The easiest way to do this is deleting the history.json and stats.json files.
3. Thread failure
   The application might stop working due to recursive threading calls or something simmilar. If this happens a message similar to: Error in Thread nÂ° X, will be shown in the command line. To solve it, it would
   be enough to close the programm and re open it again.

### Use of git

We used git to manage the project, each of us had a branch where we worked on our part of the project and then we merged it to the main branch. At the end we had issues with using different branches due to timerush.

### Challenges faced by each member
#### @Massimiliano

- Keeping the project organized and structured
- It was difficult to communicate about changes in each others branches so sometimes we had errors after merging to main
- POM file is not intuitive

#### @Violetta

- Communication within the group
- Issues with Libraries
- Issues with completely understanding the structure of the different classes
- Issues with working on both the project and the other courses

#### @Gersson

- Working constantly on the project while following the other courses and projects.
- Communicating with the other members of the group
- Solving tricky bugs implying java libraries, mainly because an incorrect type/class, reading and understanding the documentation could be tricky at times.
-(2nd session) Threading in graphical interfaces is hard to handle with little experience.
-(2nd session) Working on the project instead of having vacations was particularly tough.

#### @Sebastiano
- Developing and testing simulation and stats classes
- Developing and testing JSON serialization/deserialization
- Developing a part of stats in App and Controller classes
- Communicate and collaborate was tricky but it gave me experience on how to collaborate within a team of developers
- The most difficult problem I faced was the Jackson serialization. In fact, Jackson's documentation is not so well described and this makes debugging a tough duty to carry out.
